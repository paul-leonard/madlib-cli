## Overview
This module produces a fun textual madlib game where you can go on a magical journey!  Discover your very own story!

## Architecture
A template story is used from a provided text file.  The text file is read in and the words needing replacement are identified through a parsing operation.  The user, game player, is prompted for inputs to create the story.  The produced story is printed in the terminal and also written to a new text file for later enjoyment.
